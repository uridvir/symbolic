# symbolic
Symbolic math library in C++, for fun and probably not profit.

This is just a small project exploring template metaprogramming in C++20.
The basic concept is that the library would make using mathematical functions in code both aesthetically pleasing and efficient.
It does this by doing all calculations at compile-time, using templates.

At the moment it isn't functional, but if I have an idea of how to evaluate integrals at compile-time I may revisit the project.
